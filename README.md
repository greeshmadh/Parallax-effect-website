# Dynamic Responsive Website

1. The 3D parallax project features a home page where elements move in different directions and speeds based on the mouse pointer, creating a dynamic visual effect. The parallax effect, where background elements move slower than foreground ones, adds depth and motion to the design. Additionally, the home page is fully responsive, automatically adjusting its size according to the screen size.

2. The Snake Plant Website is a  JavaScript-based project that utilizes various dynamic effects, including a parallax effect, to create an engaging and interactive website focused on providing a comprehensive overview of snake plants and how to maintain them.
