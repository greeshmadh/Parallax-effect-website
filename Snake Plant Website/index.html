                <p>
                    It is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, spreading by way of its creeping rhizome,
                    which is sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal
                    rosette. Mature leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range from
                    70–90 centimeters long and 5–6 centimeters wide, though it can reach heights above 2 m in optimal
                    conditions.

                    Also known as <em>Dracaena trifasciata</em>. A species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae,
                    native to tropical West Africa from Nigeria east to the Congo. It is most commonly known as the snake
                    plant, Saint George's sword, mother-in-law's tongue, and viper's bowstring hemp etc.

                    Most commonly now people keep snake plant as a home indoor plant as they are easy to care, pleasing
                    for eyes and good home decor. <em>Fact:-</em> Snake plants are considered to be relatively safe, but
                    they’re mildly toxic if consumed. Their leaves contain a poison that can cause swelling and numbness
                    on the tongue if eaten in large doses. It’s wise to keep this plant away from children and animals who
                    are prone to nibbling.

                        <p>
                            Similar to other household succulents, snake plants help to filter indoor air. What is unique
                            about this particular plant is that it’s one of the few plants that can convert carbon dioxide
                            (CO2) into oxygen at night. This quality makes it an ideal plant for bedroom decor, since it
                            can help regulate healthy airflow.

                        <p>
                            Snake plants are also known for their ability to help remove toxic air pollutants. In small
                            contributions, snake plants can absorb cancer-causing pollutants, including:
                        <ul>

                    <li><em>Due to the shape of their large, flat leaves, they will gather dust very easily and begin to look very unaesthetic if they are not dusted down regularly. You must be careful while doing this to ensure you don’t damage the leaves and cause scarring.</em></li>
                    <li>It is best practice to check your plant’s leaves, root system, and soil for any signs of pests or diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate-</strong>Snake plants can live in most conditions as long as the temperature never reaches below 50°F (10°C).</li>
                    <li><strong>Watering-</strong>Use the ‘soak and dry’ method of watering for your succulent plant. Touch the soil every day and only water the plant if the soil is completely dry. This is very important as premature watering will lead to root rot and similar diseases.</li>

                <p>I love my snake plant so much. It was my first plant that got so attached to. But the first snake plant faded away due to rottening in the roots that is because of heavy watering. But my second one is growing all good. Dad got me the second one because I felt really really sad about the first one going out. I'm taking good care of my plant and it growing well you know. Touch wood. I'm happy it gets new leaves and grows into a big plant. Now I'm thinking of propagating it cause its grown a bunch of leaves. Don't want to crowd it and disturb it's growth.

              <h2> About</h2><br>
                <p> It is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, spreading by way of its creeping rhizome, which is sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal rosette. Mature leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range from 70–90 centimeters long and 5–6 centimeters wide, though it can reach heights above 2 m in optimal conditions. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Also known as <em> Dracaena trifasciata </em>. A species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to tropical West Africa from Nigeria east to the Congo. It is most commonly known as the snake plant, Saint George's sword, mother-in-law's tongue, and viper's bowstring hemp etc. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Most commonly now people keep snake plant as a home indoor plant as they are easy to care, pleasing for eyes and good home decor.
                <em>Fact:-</em>Snake plants are considered to be relatively safe, but they’re mildly toxic if consumed. Their leaves contain a poison that can cause swelling and numbness on the tongue if eaten in large doses. It’s wise to keep this plant away from children and animals who are prone to nibbling.</p>

              <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Filter indoor air</li>
                  <li>Remove toxic pollutants</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                  <li><h4>Filter indoor air</h4>
                    <p>Similar to other household succulents, snake plants help to filter indoor air. What is unique about this particular plant is that it’s one of the few plants that can convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen at night. This quality makes it an ideal plant for bedroom decor, since it can help regulate healthy airflow.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><h4> Remove toxic pollutant</h4>
                    <p>Snake plants are also known for their ability to help remove toxic air pollutants. In small contributions, snake plants can absorb cancer-causing pollutants, including:
                      <ul>
                        <li>CO2</li>
                        <li>Benzene</li>

              <h2>Care</h2>
                <p>The care you take about your plants is the most important thing ever. As much as you take care of your plants with love it'll grow better and live longer. Here are some must do routines to keep your plant healthy and happy.</p>
                <p>Caring for snake plants is very easy, in fact, it is like caring for most succulent species. When cared for correctly, snake plants grow rapidly, and they are ideal plants for propagation.</p>
                <ul><h3>Caring tips</h3>
                  <li>Pot them in cactus or succulent soil that is porous with great drainage to stop the roots from suffocating.</li>
                  <li><em>Due to the shape of their large, flat leaves, they will gather dust very easily and begin to look very unaesthetic if they are not dusted down regularly. You must be careful while doing this to ensure you don’t damage the leaves and cause scarring.</em></li>
                  <li>It is best practice to check your plant’s leaves, root system, and soil for any signs of pests or diseases.</li>
                  <li><strong>Climate-</strong>Snake plants can live in most conditions as long as the temperature never reaches below 50°F (10°C).</li>
                  <li><strong>Watering-</strong>Use the ‘soak and dry’ method of watering for your succulent plant. Touch the soil every day and only water the plant if the soil is completely dry. This is very important as premature watering will lead to root rot and similar diseases.</li>
              <img src="plant.gif" width=200 height=200 />
                  <li><strong>Light-</strong>If you want your snake plant to grow rapidly, place it in a sunny corner of the house, in partial or indirect sunlight. Likewise, if you want your plant to grow slower, place them in a shaded area that gets some sunlight during the day.</li>
                  <li>You should always plant your snake plant in pots rather than in large containers that can’t be moved around. This is so that you can control the plant’s environment at all times.</li>
                </ul>
              <h2>Propagation</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>V-cut</strong>Cut off a healthy leaf near its base and make an upside-down V cut at the bottom.Cut off a healthy leaf near its base and make an upside-down V cut at the bottom.Once roots have started to form (3 to 5 weeks), you can keep in water or transfer to soil.</li>
                  <li><strong>Leaf cutting</strong>Cut a 3- to 4-inch section of the leaf and stick it in some moist potting soil. Keep this evenly moist but not wet, and in several weeks to a month, small plantlets will begin to grow from the base of the cutting. These can be separated into individual plants or left as a clump.</li>
                  <li>Most varieties of snake plant with variegated leaves are actually a chimera, a plant mutation that causes the variegated foliage. Chimeras can't be propagated via leaf cuttings as with normal snake plants because the new plants will lose their coloring, turning into all-green versions. The only way to propagate variegated chimeras is by division.</li>
                </ol>
